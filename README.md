Incite! - CloudWatch Insights queries made (very) easy
======================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gogama/incite.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/gogama/incite) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gogama/incite)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gogama/incite) [![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/gogama/incite)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogama/incite)




TODO list in order:

1. Remove hint support as it overcomplicates to little benefit.
2. Audit the logging code to ensure we log enough worthwhile status info.
3. To behave like encoding/json, make Unmarshal keep trying after encountering error. 
4. Write README.
